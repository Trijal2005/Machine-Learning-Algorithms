# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
All the Machine Learning algorithms I have Learned and tried out with some dataset
This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms that I learned during my 5th semester. Each algorithm is organized into a separate folder, containing code and explanations for the respective algorithm.
## Algorithms Covered
1. **Decision Tree**
   - Implementation and explanation of decision tree classification.
   - Includes a walkthrough of splitting criteria like Gini Index and Information Gain.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**
   - Implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification tasks.
   - Explanation of distance metrics like Euclidean and Manhattan.
3. **Linear Regression**
   - Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression.
   - Includes a mathematical overview of the least squares method.
4. **Logistic Regression**
   - Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification.
   - Includes concepts of sigmoid function and cost optimization.
5. **Naive Bayes**
   - Implementation of Naive Bayes for text classification and other tasks.
   - Covers conditional probabilities and Bayes' theorem.
## Structure
Each folder contains:
- **Code**: The Python implementation of the algorithm.
- **Data**: Example datasets used for training and testing.
- **Explanation**: A detailed explanation or Jupyter Notebook for understanding the algorithm.
